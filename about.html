        My name is Raevan Gregson and I have been working with computers ever
      since I was old enough to get my hands on them. At first what began as a
      interest in graphic design and photography my passion has grown into developing
      mobile apps as well as beginning to pursue the web development side of things. Hopefully
      I will begin this journey with Grand Circus's Facebook bootcamp beginning in October. Stay tuned
      as I continue to grow my site through out the journey.

        <p><img id= "circus"src="images/grandcircus.jpg">"Earning a computer science degree has been the
          typical route to take in order to start a career as a developer. However, university CS curricula
           can sometimes lack the technical training companies are searching for. A coding bootcamp is a perfect
           way to fill in any gaps previous instruction may have left. Our intensive program will ensure that youâ€™re
           ready to hit the ground running on day one of your new gig. We also work closely with our hiring partners
           to ensure that our students are mastering the exact skills recruiters are looking for in the industry." -
